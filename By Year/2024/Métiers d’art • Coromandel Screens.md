# Métiers d’art 2024/5: Coromandel Screens ⬛️⭐️


From [Chanel](https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/collection/metiers-art-2024-25/): Presented at nightfall on the West Lake in Hangzhou, China, the 2024/25 Métiers d’art collection draws its inspiration from Gabrielle Chanel’s Coromandel screens, that she cherished all her life and that still adorn the walls of her apartment in Paris. Embroidered floral motifs, jade green, pink and sky blue colours are a nod to the Chinese lacquered screens and to their brilliance.  
  
Each of the silhouettes reveals a unique sense of detail, both visible and hidden. From phosphorescent braids to long coats in precious tweeds and envelope-shaped pockets, the collection is an invitation to a poetic voyage.
