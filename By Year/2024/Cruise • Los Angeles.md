# Cruise 2023/24: Los Angeles 🌅

Also referred to as: One Night Only, City of Angels
Creative Director: [[Virginie Viard]]

May 9th 2023 [[Paramount Studios]] [[Los Angeles, CA, USA]]


With apologies to the late, great Karl Lagerfeld, that resort 2008 happening had nothing on the spectacle the house put on at the Paramount Studios lot tonight for resort 2024, what with stars including [[Margot Robbie]], [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Issa Rae]], and [[Marion Cotillard]] lighting up the front row, and a post-show performance by none other than the native Angeleno [[Snoop Dogg]]. Mixed in with the celebrity watchers, there was also a smattering of striking WGA members outside the lot urging show-goers to “tell Paramount to give writers a fair deal.”

As a matter of fact, Viard didn’t look at the silver screen or the red carpet for inspiration, but to what appeared to be a more quotidian example of Los Angeles: the Venice Beach boardwalk, a see-and-be-seen playground for roller skaters, weight lifters, beach bunnies, and epic sunsets.
