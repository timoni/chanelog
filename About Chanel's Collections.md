# About Chanel's Collections

Chanel releases ten collections a year, each with its own letter code. There is also a continuous 'classic' collection, demarcated with the letter V, for certain bags and accessories.

| Letter Code | Name                             | Also may be referred to as...                        | Last Known Link At chanel.com                                                                                       |

Note that Cruise is always referred to by the upcoming year, not the prior year it was released. For example, Cruise 2024/25 is referred to as 25C.

\*There is confusion around Métiers and Pre-Fall. You will often see Métiers referred to pre-fall in even publications like Vogue. But according to Bruno Pavlovsky in 2015 (see below), Métiers is *not* pre-fall.  Note that Métiers d'Art began in 2001/02, and the Acts were not introduced some time in the mid-10s. I believe this is what has led to the ongoing confusion.
### More on Acts and Pre-Season Collections
For both spring-summer and fall-winter, there are pre-collections, as noted above, also known as "Act One" of their respective seasons. They are not shown on the runway, and they are catalogued with a straightforward lookbook rather than a themed, staged shoot. They tend towards daywear, loungewear, and overall less intricate creations.

The earliest reference I can find about the Acts online is from page **source** (not in the text of the page itself) on Chouquette's [Chanel SS14 Press Day](https://clairechanelle.com/chanel-ss14-press-day/), from December 15, 2013. Acts were new enough to need explanation in an article from WWD in early 2015, and they still remain something of an unknown concept. I have excerpted the relevant sections below.

| Only 10 days after the couture, Chanel staged another fashion show here Friday — although strictly for buyers.<br><br>About 200 of them gathered at Chanel’s Rue Cambon salons for the commercial unveiling of its pre-fall collection, known internally as Act 1, with the fall 2015 runway show Karl Lagerfeld will mount in Paris next month known as Act 2.<br><br>While lesser known, the pre-fall range spans a vast offering of ready-to-wear and accessories, and is one of six collections delivered to Chanel’s boutiques and wholesale clients each year.<br><br>“Métiers d’Art has nothing to do with pre-fall, and cruise has nothing to do with pre-spring,” explained Bruno Pavlovsky, president of Chanel fashion, referring to the two itinerant fashion shows that begin each season, and noting these “special events” also exalt a facet of Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s legacy, and nod to local dress customs.<br><br>Last year, Chanel traveled to Salzburg for its latest Métiers d’Art, a luxurious collection embellished with the work of the specialty couture ateliers that Chanel owns, and to Dubai for its cruise show. Each was followed by another interim pre-collection.<br><br>Pavlovsky explained that the Métiers d’Art range is delivered to stores in May, Act 1 pre-fall in July and the Act 2 runway collection in September. “This allows us to have something new every two months in the boutiques,” he said, noting that most of its designer competitors only create two collections a season: pre- and runway.<br><br>Chanel began staging cruise shows in 2000, and added the Métiers d’Art range in 2002. ...Chanel’s Act 1 pre-collections are “purchased more by product category” than runway collections, and they tend to be more focused on daywear, Pavlovsky noted. <br><br>...Lagerfeld occasionally shoots short movies or video clips around the Act 1 collections, with most communication done in the digital sphere, Pavlovsky noted.<br> |

| No one could have foreseen the reverberations of a small, 30-look show in December 2002 that Lagerfeld dubbed “[[Satellite Love]],” his term for this new concept: a between-season collection of ready-to-wear embellished by the specialty ateliers Chanel began to acquire in order to preserve the rare craft skills used by the handful of remaining couture houses.<br><br>It was a charming event, held at the historic Rue Cambon couture salons, with the 65 guests in attendance — including chief executive officers from luxury rivals Hermes and Louis Vuitton, which used Chanel’s ateliers — handed packs of CC-branded chocolate cigarettes. Hard to remember exactly the clothes; impossible not to recognize now how prescient this was.<br><br>Lagerfeld would end his career at Chanel with a self-imposed mandate to design 10 collections a year. In 2018, he added ski and swimwear capsule lines to the ready-to-wear offer: [[Coco Neige]] and [[Coco Beach]]. The designer got the idea while on summer vacation in Saint-Tropez, where he noticed the Chanel store lacked a strong assortment of beach gear.<br><br>(In addition to his biannual ready-to-wear show, the designer was responsible for two couture shows, a cruise collection and the annual Métiers d’Art line. He also oversaw the pre-collections that are shown internally to buyers from Chanel’s boutiques worldwide.) |
