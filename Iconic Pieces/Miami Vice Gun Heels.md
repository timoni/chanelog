An iconic pair of pistol heels from [[Cruise • Miami|Cruise 2008/9: Miami 🌴]]. Also known as the "gun shoes".

"One of the most eye catching piece is the “Miami Vice” gun shoes...“inspired by an image of a gun (Karl) saw somewhere, and he gave the tear to shoe designer [[Laurence Dacade]], who employed plexi to make them functional." ([Nitrolicious](https://nitrolicious.com/2008/05/16/chanel-cruise-2009-collection/), [[May 2008]])

[[Madonna]] wearing the gun shoes in [[October 2008]] to her film debut, "Filth and Wisdom". For some reason this sparked controversy. I have no idea why.
