# Cruise Collections

Like the rest of the winter collections, Cruise labels span two years. Collections here are listed by the second year, so for example, 2025 is Cruise 2024/25. This is because Chanel's collection [[About Chanel's Collections|letter code]] uses the second year: Cruise 2024/25 is referred to as [[25C]].

Note that the year may be handled differently between by news outlets, article, and resellers. This confusion is exacerbated due to Chanel's collection code system only including a single year.
